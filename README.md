## Contributing

Should a feature supported by the [tapoctl server](https://github.com/WhySoBad/tapoctl) which you want to have be missing from the app or you have some
design or code improvements? Feel free to open an issue or pull request!

This app is my first android app therefore I'm pretty sure I missed some best practices - let me know if you have any feedback!
